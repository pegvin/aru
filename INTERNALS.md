# Aru Internals

this document roughly explains about code of Aru & stuff, so that contributors or any code reader get's some idea.

---
## History
Aru was basically developed by following the tutorial ["Build your own text editor"](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/), the name "Aru" is short for a name of my friend.

---
## Code
syntax highlighter and stuff is inside the main file but every file serves it's purpose. the struct `erow` in `main.h` contains row information and also it contains what part of the row should be colored how.

Will Be Update Soon...
